  h1: Holiday Pop-Up
  p: Check out Beau's Bonbons Holiday Pop-ups across Ottawa this December! The holidays are one of the best and
  busiest times of the year. We feel that candy is the great de-stresser and an awesome gift to boot!

  section 1: Products
  sweet - delectably sweet gummy and hard candies for any candy lover!
  spicy - can you handle the heat? try our ginger sriracha and pablano candies!
  vegan - we guarantee they taste better than our regular candies!
  gift bags - mix and match our flavours for gifts...or maybe keep a baggy for yourselfâ€”we won't tell.

  section 2: About
  Beau's Bonbons values bringing a smile to your day. Starting as an online site, we've sold millions of our products

  great start. Our special candy making processes are sure to make your day sweet.
